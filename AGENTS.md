# ELM_makeSurfdata

Local mirror/workspace for ELM surface dataset generation. See the workspace
root `AGENTS.md` for Pathfinder safety, SSH, and Slurm rules, and
`pathfinder_slurm_p_q_mem.md` at the workspace root for partition, QoS, and
memory selection.

The remote root is on persistent project NFS. Keep durable code, Slurm scripts,
small configs, and small reproducible inputs in Git here; keep mapping files,
NetCDF, and diagnostic figures remote or in ignored local paths.

## Versioning model

GitHub is the authoritative version history for code, Slurm scripts,
documentation, and small configs. This local directory and the declared
Pathfinder remote root are mirrors/workspaces. Changes may originate locally or
on Pathfinder; after meaningful code/config/job/documentation changes, sync them
into this project Git repository, commit, and push to GitHub.

Use `scp` or `rsync` in either direction only after making the direction explicit:
`remote -> local` to refresh this mirror from Pathfinder, or `local -> remote` to
stage files on Pathfinder for a run. Do not use `rsync --delete` unless the user
explicitly requests that exact deletion behavior.
